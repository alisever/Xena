# Geometry in Lean
An attempt to formalise geometry in Lean.

## Outline

During the summer of 2018, I was part of the Xena project run by Kevin Buzzard. I found this book: 

Schwabh√§user, W., Szmielew, W., and Alfred Tarski, 1983. Metamathematische Methoden in der Geometrie. Springer-Verlag.

Using google translate, I was able to work out most of what was going on. I mostly stuck to the progression in the book, following the chapters one by one. Of course, I was learning Lean during this period, so I made many revisions to my older code as I learned new things. I am by no means an expert at Lean, so I am sure there are many ways to improve my code. I'm going to make a more detailed explanation of my code in another file.
